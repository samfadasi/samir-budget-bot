# Upgrade to Mastra v1
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/guides/migrations/upgrade-to-v1

In this guide you'll learn how to upgrade through breaking changes in pre-v1 versions of Mastra. It'll also help you upgrade to Mastra v1.

Use your package manager to update your project's versions. Be sure to update **all** Mastra packages at the same time.

<Callout type="info">

Versions mentioned in the headings refer to the `@mastra/core` package. If necessary, versions of other Mastra packages are called out in the detailed description.

All Mastra packages have a peer dependency on `@mastra/core` so your package manager can inform you about compatibility.
