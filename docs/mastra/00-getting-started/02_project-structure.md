# Project Structure
[EN] Source: https://mastra.ai/en/docs/getting-started/project-structure

Your new Mastra project, created with the `create mastra` command, comes with a predefined set of files and folders to help you get started.

Mastra is a framework, but it's **unopinionated** about how you organize or colocate your files. The CLI provides a sensible default structure that works well for most projects, but you're free to adapt it to your workflow or team conventions. You could even build your entire project in a single file if you wanted! Whatever structure you choose, keep it consistent to ensure your code stays maintainable and easy to navigate.

## Default project structure

A project created with the `create mastra` command looks like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="mastra" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="agents" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="weather-agent.ts" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="tools" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="weather-tool.ts" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="workflows" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="weather-workflow.ts" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="scorers" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="weather-scorer.ts" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.File name="index.ts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name=".env.example" />
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
  <FileTree.File name="tsconfig.json" />
</FileTree>

Tip - Use the predefined files as templates. Duplicate and adapt them to quickly create your own agents, tools, workflows, etc.
</Callout>

### Folders

Folders organize your agent's resources, like agents, tools, and workflows.

| Folder                 | Description |
| ---------------------- | ------------ |
| `src/mastra`           | Entry point for all Mastra-related code and configuration.|
| `src/mastra/agents`    | Define and configure your agents - their behavior, goals, and tools. |
| `src/mastra/workflows` | Define multi-step workflows that orchestrate agents and tools together. |
| `src/mastra/tools`     | Create reusable tools that your agents can call |
| `src/mastra/mcp`       | (Optional) Implement custom MCP servers to share your tools with external agents |
| `src/mastra/scorers`   | (Optional) Define scorers for evaluating agent performance over time |
| `src/mastra/public`    | (Optional) Contents are copied into the `.build/output` directory during the build process, making them available for serving at runtime |

### Top-level files

Top-level files define how your Mastra project is configured, built, and connected to its environment.

| File                  | Description |
| --------------------- | ------------ |
| `src/mastra/index.ts` | Central entry point where you configure and initialize Mastra. |
| `.env.example`        | Template for environment variables - copy and rename to `.env` to add your secret [model provider](/models) keys. |
| `package.json`        | Defines project metadata, dependencies, and available npm scripts. |
| `tsconfig.json`       | Configures TypeScript options such as path aliases, compiler settings, and build output. |
